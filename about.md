# About

Hi, I'm Liang, a student developer based in Hangzhou China, and an open-source enthusiast focused on frontend and web technologies. Sometimes I also do design-related works.

I'm always excited about contribution and open source, I'm a contributor of some cutting-edge projects like [oxc-project/oxc](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc) and [vitejs/devtools](https://github.com/vitejs/devtools).

At the same time, I'm currently studying in a public junior high school in China and now :YearOld{birth="2011-03-11"} years old. You can view [my blog](./blog?type=life) to learn more about the real life of a Chinese student and how I strike a balance among heavy study pressure and my hobbies.

If you happen to understand Chinese, I have a Chinese nickname `良米`, I also run a BiliBili account(in Mandarin) to share my story, you can find it [here](https://space.bilibili.com/1964165864).

Besides programming, I have some other interests. I'm an anime fan and I sometimes play Minecraft PVP / Survive with friends and make Minecraft mods and plugins. I'm also a cuber and I'm able to solve a 3x3 one within 20 seconds.

Feel free to reach me out!

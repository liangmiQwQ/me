# About

Hi, I'm Liang, a student developer based in Hangzhou China, and an open-source enthusiast focused on frontend and web technologies.

I'm always excited about contribution and open source, I'm a contributor of some cutting-edge projects like [oxc-project/oxc](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc) and [vitejs/devtools](https://github.com/vitejs/devtools).

At the same time, I'm currently studying in a public junior high school in China and now :old{birth="2011-3-11"} years old. You can view [my growth timeline](./timeline?exclude=tech) to learn more about the real life of a Chinese student.

If you happen to understand Chinese, I have a Chinese nickname `良米`, I also run a BiliBili account to share my story, you can find it [here](https://space.bilibili.com/1964165864).

I have a wide range of interests, I'm an anime fan and I sometimes play Minecraft with friends and make Minecraft mods and plugins.

Feel free to reach me
